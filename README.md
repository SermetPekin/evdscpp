# evdscpp

**evdscpp** is a C++ library for fast, efficient, and user-friendly interaction with the EVDS API Server. Designed with performance in mind, it provides built-in caching, an Excel export option, and an intuitive user interface for configuring and retrieving data. `evdscpp` can be extended for integration with other C++ projects and offers options for use as a standalone application.

## Features

- **Fast Data Fetching**: Optimized C++ code enables quick and efficient data retrieval from the EVDS API.
- **Caching**: Caches results locally to avoid redundant requests, minimizing API calls and improving performance.
- **Excel Export**: Automatically exports data to Excel format for easy analysis and sharing.
- **Configuration Support**: Reads configuration files for API keys, date ranges, and other options.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple and flexible CLI for specifying data queries and configuration options.
- **Extensible for Other Projects**: Can be used as a library in other C++ projects, enabling seamless data access from the EVDS API.

## Build Instructions

To build `evdscpp`, use the following commands:

```bash
cd src/build
cmake ..
make
./evdscpp
```




## Environment Configuration

This project uses an `.env` file to store sensitive information, such as your EVDS API key. The `.env` file should be created in the root directory of the project to keep your API keys and other sensitive information secure and organized.

### Example `.env` File

Below is an example of what your `.env` file might look like. Replace `ABCDEFG` with your actual API key.

```
# .env file

# EVDS API key for authenticating API requests
EVDS_APIKEY=ABCDEFG
```

### Usage

The program automatically reads the `.env` file and retrieves the `EVDS_APIKEY` value when making requests to the EVDS API. Ensure that this file is present in the root directory before running the program.


### How to Get Your EVDS API Key

You can obtain a free EVDS API key by registering on the EVDS website provided by the Central Bank of Turkey. Visit [EVDS API Documentation and Key Registration](https://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/index.php?/evds/userDocs) to sign up and receive your API key.




## Example Usage

```bash
# 1. each index will have its own file :
./evdscpp TP.DK.USD.A,TP.DK.EUR.A


# 2 two indexes in the same file :
./evdscpp TP.DK.USD.A-TP.DK.EUR.A

# 3. Using indexes with named arguments:
./evdscpp TP.DK.USD.A,TP.DK.EUR.A --start_date 01-01-2021 --end_date 31-12-2021 --cache true

# Another example with a different index:
./evdscpp bie_yssk --cache true

# Another example with a 3 different indexes :
# this will create two different files. One for the first index `bie_yssk` and one for these indexes TP.DK.USD.A-TP.DK.EUR.A 
./evdscpp bie_yssk,TP.DK.USD.A-TP.DK.EUR.A --cache true

```



## Manual Compilation

If you prefer to compile `evdscpp` manually, you can use the following `g++` command. Make sure you have all necessary dependencies, including `libcurl` and `nlohmann-json`, installed and available in your include/library paths.

```bash
g++ -g -o ./evdscpp ./src/main.cpp -lcurl -I./include -L./extern/nlohmann --std=c++20

```

### Explanation of the Command

- `-g`: Enables debugging information in the compiled binary.
- `-o ./evdscpp`: Specifies the output path and name of the compiled executable (`./evdscpp`).
- `./src/main.cpp`: The main source file for your program.
- `-lcurl`: Links the `libcurl` library, necessary for making HTTP requests.
- `-L./extern/nlohmann`: Specifies the path to the `nlohmann-json` library. Adjust this path based on your setup.
- `--std=c++20`: Specifies the C++ standard to use (C++20).

After running this command, you should have an executable `evdscpp` located in the current directory.



## Configuration

`evdscpp` reads configuration parameters directly from the command line. You can specify options such as:

- **`--start_date`**: The start date for the data request (format: DD-MM-YYYY).
- **`--end_date`**: The end date for the data request (format: DD-MM-YYYY).
- **`--cache`**: Set to `true` to enable caching, which reduces redundant API requests.

If no start or end dates are specified, `evdscpp` defaults to a predefined date range.

## Integration with Other C++ Projects

`evdscpp` is designed to be easily integrated into other C++ projects, allowing developers to fetch data from the EVDS API with minimal setup. Simply include the library in your project and use the available functions.
